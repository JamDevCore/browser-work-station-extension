Browser work station

'Create your easy to access work station.'

If like me you have a whole load of relevant links to open when you start work, or a particular activity such as banking, or you just want to save a whole bunch of tabs at once to come back to. This simple extension will be exactly what you need.

You can create and save lists of urls that you need and open them all at once with the click of a button.

To make it even easier you can grab all your open tabs from the current window and save them automagically, ready to start fresh next time you are at your browser.

As a developer working in a small company, when I start my day I have a number of websites to open. Github, Intercom, ProductBoard, Basecamp, Gmail, Todoist, Notion, FullStory are just a few of the websites I need within the first half an hour to an hour of my day. So I created this extension to allow me to open them all at once at the start of the day, and if I accidentally or purposely close my browser window. I also have stations set up for my banking, and a few other tasks that often need multiple sites open.
